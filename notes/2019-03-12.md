# Aim:

## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
- Used to create other languages
- defines a set of rules for encoding data in a format which is both *human-readable* and *machine-readable*.
- note a formatting lanuage
- allows to define a filetype
- framework for creating markup-based grammars
- uses some syntactic standards of HTML (tags, attributes)
- emphasizes **organizing and representing** data (instead of rendering/displaying it)
- an XML namespace is defined by the tags and attributes associated with a specific XML language

## Raster image encoding:
  - raster encoding: **bit-by-bit** specification of an image (even if compressed, a la PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc...)

## SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics
- vector image format
- XML-based
- an SVG img and its actions are defined in xml text files
- Vector graphics are images not represented in a 2D grid of pixels (raster) but instead as a **list of drawing commands** (eg: line, circle, rectangle curve)
- Biggest advantage to vector graphics is that they are **scalable to any size** without any loss in resolution
- `<svg>` element is designed to store SVG code (ie: SVG XML elements)
- **xmlns**: Attribute that identifies the namespace for the specific XML langauge being used.
- eg:
``` html
<svg xmlns="http://w3.org/2000/svg/">
  <!-- <symbols defined in svg here> -->
</svg>
```
